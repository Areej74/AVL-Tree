# AVL-Tree
Simple implementation of AVL Tree including Insertion, Deletion and Search Functions.

Insert Function:
The *Insert* function , when called, is used to insert a node to the AVL Tree.

Rotation Functions:
LRotate:
*LRotate* function performs Left Rotation on the unbalanced node.

RRotate:
*RRotate* function performs Right Rotation on the unbalanced node.

Height Function:
*height* function calculates the height of an avl tree from the root.

Minimum Value Function:
*FindMin* function returns the node with the minimum value in an avl tree.

Balance Funtion:
*Balance* function calculates the balance factor of an avl tree by subtracting the height of right subtree from the height of left subtree.

Preorder Function:
*PreOrder* function prints the values of all the nodes of an avl tree in a given manner (V-L-R).

Delete Function:
*Delete* function removes the node of the given value.

Search Function:
*Search* function verifies that the given value exists in the avl tree or not by printing true or false.
